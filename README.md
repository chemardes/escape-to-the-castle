#### Description
---

Escape to the Castle was a team project for QUB's CSC1030 WEB TECHNOLOGIES module. The aim for this team project was to develop a modern rendition of a classic text adventure game. My team and I came up with **ESCAPE TO THE CASTLE** - a game where a player is expected to pass through an abandoned asylum to return to a safe haven (in this case, the castle) within a timeframe of 5 minutes. Throughout the game, my team members and I have curated a series of complex puzzles for the player to complete to get through each room and escape the asylum. A statistics page is also provided at the end of the game to display how well their attempt to finish the game was.
